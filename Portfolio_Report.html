<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>One critical task was obtaining the neighborhood
associated with each register in all gathered datasets, as neighborhoods were
envisioned as the project’s final indexer for the obtained quality of life
scores. The housing data happened to already come with neighborhood information
in all its data points, dispensing any preprocessing to obtain them. The
education dataset’s only georeference was school names, which were processed in
the google maps API to obtain each school’s neighborhood. Because some schools
had identical names to other schools outside of Los Angeles, this approach also
generated data from neighborhoods outside of Los Angeles, which had to be
removed with a second filter that allowed only LA neighborhoods through. To
avoid data loss this filter was applied only later in the process, at the Spark
stage. Lastly, the crime data came with the latitude and longitude associated
with each record, which were also converted into neighborhoods through the
google maps API.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

python API using the reverse_geocode() method, which takes a tuple of
(latitude, longitude) and extracts all information related to that point in the
globe. This information includes country, state, county, city, neighborhood and
well as additional information for certain locations. As the data provided
varies from one place to another, so does the structure of the API’s output,
and hence it’s necessary to explore all elements in the json returned by the
API until the element containing neighborhood data is found. Then the
neighborhood name can be extracted and appended to the record from whose
(latitude, longitude) tuple it originated. Below is the resulting geomap
colored by neighborhood.</span></p>

as not only was it necessary to obtain neighborhoods for all records, it was
also necessary to create scoring metrics for each of the prioritized topics,
each of which required a customized and thorough approach, examples of which
are given in the following paragraphs. For the housing and education data,
after the scoring features were obtained, the data points were then aggregated
by neighborhood, with the scores being averaged. With the preprocessing finished,
the data was then saved into a CSV that is later read by a Python program into

research dataset on housing. This dataset contains time series data on the
housing prices in various neighborhoods across the United States. This specific
score was computed using Zillow’s internal evaluation, Zestimate. There are
also additional identifiers such as SizeRank, RegionName, RegionType,
StateName, State, Metro and CountyName. For our task, we solely looked at the
housing prices in the 2019 timeframe while querying the RegionName that
contains the neighborhood type based on State being California and Metro and
CountyName containing Los Angeles. Since the neighborhoods are already included
in the results, there is no need to utilize Google Maps API or the KNN
algorithm to find or classify neighborhoods. </span></p>

strength of the schools in each area. For this evaluation the ACT scores were
obtained from the California Department of Education website which contains the
school name and ACT average score for four sections - Reading, English, Math,
Science. This raw data needed to be processed and cleaned to extract
information features using the following workflow: First, utilize the google
maps API to reverse school name to geolocation. Second, remove the record if
the geolocation couldn't be found by google maps API. Third, aggregate the
records based on neighborhoods. Contrary to the two other two datasets (Crime
and Housing),  ACT datasets contain only 211 records because there are around
200 high schools in LA. </span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'> page. The whole dataset
contained 2 million records, covering years 2010-2019, using all of which
proved too burdensome, hence only records for the year of 2019 were kept,
totalling about 200k records. Those records already contained latitude and
longitude, hence the second step consisted of using the google maps API reverse
geocode method and obtaining the neighborhood in which the crime happened.
Unfortunately the API has limitations, which stopped the queries after around
100k had been sent. This forced the team to resort to using a KNN algorithm to
predict the neighborhoods for the rest of the data, which was step three. A
train-test split showed this approach to be highly effective, as neighborhoods
are by definition linearly separable classes in a low (two) dimensional space,
about as ideal a setting for a KNN algorithm as one could hope for, resulting
in a classification accuracy of 97%. The KNN algorithm’s excellent results can
be verified in the image below, which visually compares the neighborhoods
obtained from the Google Maps API (about 100K samples, all of which were used
to train the algorithm) , and the neighborhoods from KNN (about 100k samples).
Step four was the creation of a feature called “Crime_Weighted_Norm”, which was
obtained by converting the “Crime Code” associated with each register. “Crime
Code” indicates the crime committed, with lower crime code numbers representing
more serious offenses - the full Crime Code encoding is available at </span><span

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>. “Crime_Weighted_Norm” was
obtained by applying two distinct transformations to the crime code associated
with each record: first the scale was inverted, so that a higher number
signified a more serious crime. This was achieved by dividing 100 (the
lowest/most serious crime code) by the crime code of each data point, and as more
serious crimes have a lower crime code, those instances will have a smaller
divisor, and thus generate a larger number. The scale inversion was applied
primarily to simplify understanding, as a high score on a crime metric is more
easily associated with a more negative situation. Once this scaling was
obtained, the values were then normalized, resulting in a feature in the [0,1]
range, which simplifies the understandability of the data. Other columns on the
original dataset amounted essentially to the full public police log on each
crime, but contained no other relevant information for this project and were
discarded. Lastly, step five was storing the final dataset into MySQL.</span></p>

instead of storing data already aggregated by neighborhood. This allows for
Spark to be used to MapReduce the crime data and aggregate it by neighborhood
in a more scalable fashion (as well as allowing for extra learning). The Spark
MapReduce pipeline took the “Crime_Weighted_Norm” feature that had already been
extracted from the data prior to upload into MySQL, and averaged it by
neighborhood, while also obtaining a second feature: the count of crimes per
neighborhood, obtained by tallying the number of records registered in each

aggregated by neighborhood, and thus could be merged using Spark SQL. A total
of four Spark SQL dataframes were joined with the “fullouter” method, all of
which were already indexed by neighborhoods. Those dataframes are (1) one
containing the “Crime_Weighted_Norm”, renamed as “CrimeScore” to simplify
comprehension, (2) another with the tally of crimes per neighborhood, a feature
named “CrimeCount”, (3) a third with both features from the housing dataset
(“HousingScore” and “SizeRank”), and (4) lastly a dataframe with all ACT scores
(“AvgACT”, “AvgScrEng”, “AvgScrMath”, “AvgScrRead”, “AvgScrSci”). Thus up to
nine features were obtained for neighborhoods that were contained in the three
datasets, with some missing values being generated for neighborhoods inexistant

Summary</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>A brief summarization of the project’s overall
workflow is: first datasets are cleaned; second neighborhoods and other
features are extracted; third datasets are individually aggregated by
neighborhood; fourth datasets are uploaded to MySQL; fifth data is read from
MySQL to Spark; sixth neighborhoods are used as index to group all datasets;
seventh a filter is applied to ensure only neighborhoods in the City of Los
Angeles move forward; eight data is loaded to Firebase; ninth a search program
processes a set of neighborhoods and features from a user; tenth data
associated with the query is displayed to the user. The complete data pipeline
for this project can be seen in the architecture diagram below.</span></p>

Words</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This project proved to be a great source of learning
for the team, as it’s focus on multiple datasets, from multiple sources, with
multiple data processing and storage requirements allowed for experimentation
with a variety of tools. Selecting a realistic use case strongly contributed to
the team’s engagement and continued interest, as well as to the applicability
of the learnings. There were several learning opportunities for the team, among
the most significant ones were the challenges each team member faced in
extracting neighborhood from his/her designated dataset, resulting in the need
to use both google maps API as well as KNN. Not only did this step require
ingenuity, it also fostered team collaboration, as one student’s solution could
be adapted and replicated for the whole team. And perhaps the most unexpected
learning experience came even before all of those, when the team had to
consider the rules and expectations for the project and conceive an approach
which would combine learning class-related topics with creating a realistic
application and finding an exciting theme to work on, all of which were key
contributors to this project’s level of success.  An outstanding dynamic among
team members as well as the team’s zealous organization of tasks allowed all
requirements to be met without any peak in workload - a common source of lower
quality deliverables. Although the formal delivery of the project is complete,
the initial vision points to potential further developments, as more quality of
life aspects can be easily incorporated into the project using the
now-fleshed-out data processing pipeline.</span></p>
